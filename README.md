# githubList
List to search for github users in iOS.

## Setup
- Provide an API key as an Environment Variable - declared in the Github List scheme
    - If available, use the API key that I have sent via email
    - A token can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and doesn't need any specific permissions
- Build and run the app

## Notes
This is my first time using [Swift Testing](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swift-testing/) but I've been excited to try it out. Some of it might not be perfect but I was exploring.

I didn't put much love into the UI, I was really focused on the architecture and testability. Forgive the spartan layout, especially the error and empty views.
